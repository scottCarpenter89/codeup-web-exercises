Hi ya'll! My name is Scott Carpenter, and I live near Houston, Texas. I am husband and a father to two young childen of 6 years and 2 a month old. I am an Army veteran and I spent four years in the service training to become a special forces medic, but I had to retire due to a serious injury. I went to school for Biomedical Science at Sam Houston State University and graduated in 2020. I did that with the intent to practice medicine, but I have recently made a conscious decision to choose making a career that would allow me to spend more time with my family. I hope to use my knowledge of web development to make an impact in the healthcare community.
